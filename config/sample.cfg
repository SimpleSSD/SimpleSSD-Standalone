# Global Configuration
[global]

## Select mode
# Possible values:
#  0: Request generator mode (all configs in [trace] will be ignored)
#  1: Trace replayer mode (all configs in [generator] will be ignored)

## Log period
# Print log periodically
# 0 means no log printout
# Unit: ms (millisecond) in simulation time (not real time)

# Request generator configuration
[generator]

## This request generator will work similar to Flexible I/O tester
# Definition of Types:
#  str:  String, a sequence of alphanumeric characters
#  int:  SI integer, a sequence of numeric characters
#        Possible suffix (case sensitive):
#         10^3 base: k, m, g, t, p
#         2^10 base: K, M, G, T, P
#        Prefix of '0x' means hexadecimal number
#  bool: Boolean, a true or false value.
#        Possible value (case insensitive):
#         True: Non-zero number, T, True, Y, Yes
#         False: Otherwise
